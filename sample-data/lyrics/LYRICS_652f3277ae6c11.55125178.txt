Awaken ye deathless souls, bring to me your steel
For all those who have fallen we rebel

Come warriors unto the fight
and under this banner unite 
Thou shalt not fear any god
Take back your pride
your meaning with me

The earth will shake with your cries
To heaven your songs will arise
In the name of your souls
in the name of your freedom
Let your voices sing
Let your blades ring
And echo their words
through all FÃ³dlan

Like the colors of the sun
dragons blood in rivers run

Our cries will ride the wind with fury and with fervor
And carry warning to the ears of my usurper
If it is god you seek then you must look no further
The face of your liberation is here
I am come

Pierce the sky and pierce their hearts
for I am the wrathful
I am the God Shattering Star
